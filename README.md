This repo is only the src file from the android project and was uploaded to be used a refernce for the people who had the same problems I was having with the tutrorial. Because many steps where left out and some of the code used in the tutorial was non-functional and/or depricated, I spent a lot of time searching for solutions.

All the code in this app was up to date and working as of Sept 13th 2016, and I do not plan on making any alterations in the future.
